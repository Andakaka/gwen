2.25.0
======
March 8, 2020
- Introduce behavior rules setting to enforce good Gherkin style
  - `gwen.behavior.rules=strict|lenient`
    - `strict`: The following rules are enforced in feature files with violations reported as errors:
      - Steps in scenarios and backgrounds must satisfy *Given-When-Then* order
      - *Given* steps must set context
      - *When* steps must perform actions
      - *Then* steps must perform assertions
      - *But* steps must perform assertions (and are permitted after *Then* steps)
    - `lenient`: no rules are enforced
    - Default is `lenient` for backwards compatiblity but plan is to change it 
      to `strict` in upcoming major (v3.0.0) release

2.24.0
======
January 29, 2020
- Add assocative meta setting:
  - `gwen.associative.meta=true|false` (default is false)
  - If enabled, then if a meta file has the same name (excluding file extension) and is 
    in the same location as a feature, then load that meta last for that feature only and skip over 
    all other meta in the path to the feature that is assocaited in same way to any other features. 
    This enables users to define meta that is bound to one feature only by defininig it in a meta 
    file in the same location as the feature and naming it with the same name as the feature but 
    with the .meta extension instead (handy for cases where a meta per feature is desirable).
  - This setting is only honoured if `gwen.auto.discover.meta` is enabled (which it is by default).

2.23.0
======
January 21, 2020
- Introduce "declarative" mode for features to prevent the user of imperative 
  steps in features. Controlled through mew Gwen setting

2.22.1
======
November 23, 2019
- Introduce state levels and parallel execution for scenarions in addition to features.
  State levels are configurable with the `gwen.state.level` setting which can be set to:
  - `feature`: to give each feature a state that is shared across scenarios (default)
  - `scenario`: to give each scenario a new state that is not shared across scenarios
- The `--parallel` option now runs:
  - features in parallel when configured state level is `feature`
  - scenarios in parallel when the configured state level is `scenario`
- Added `--parallel-features` command line option to force parallel feature execution
  regardless of state level
- Input CSV data records are now resolved to Backgrounds instead of top level Scenarios
  to support both feature and scenario level states

2.21.0
======
November 12, 2019
- Integated latest Gherkin 8.1.1 parser from Cucumber to support rules and

  staggered parallel execution ~ for user request issue #18. The 
  interval can be set through the `gwen.rampup.interval.seconds` setting
  This setting is only applicable for parallel execution mode. If it is 
  not set or is set to zero, then no staggering will occur (as per default 
  behavior). 
- Added new `gwen.report.suppress.meta` setting for controlling whether or 
  not meta reports should be generated with HTML reports (default value is 
  false). If you have a lot of meta, suppressing the meta reports can 
  save a lot of disk space. Enabling this setting does not suppress the 
  hyperlinked stepdefs in feature reports (they will always be rendered).
