=====
Feb 29, 2016, 8:50 PM GMT+11 (AEDT)
- Added support for configuring a ramp up interval (in seconds) for 
  staggered parallel execution ~ for user request issue #18. The 
  interval can be set through the `gwen.rampup.interval.seconds` setting
  This setting is only applicable for parallel execution mode. If it is 
  not set or is set to zero, then no staggering will occur (as per default 
  behavior). 
- Added new `gwen.report.suppress.meta` setting for controlling whether or 
  not meta reports should be generated with HTML reports (default value is 
  false). If you have a lot of meta, suppressing the meta reports can 
  save a lot of disk space. Enabling this setting does not suppress the 
  hyperlinked stepdefs in feature reports (they will always be rendered).
