The Gwen logo is a
[Lorenz attractor](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_attractor) / 
butterfly. 
    
```
   Feature: Deterministic Chaos
    
  Scenario: The butterfly effect
      Given a deterministic nonlinear system
       When a small change is initially applied
       Then a large change will eventually result
```
 
Dynamic systems can be observed to possess chaotic behavior and this is common 
in software. The smallest of changes to programs and environments can give 
rise to the most erratic effects. Gwen evaluates software systems by 
mapping plain text specifications to executable instructions through evaluation 
engines that:

- Create conditions (_Givens_)
- Perform actions (_Whens_)
- Assert expectations (_Thens_)

The cumulative result is a chain of events that occur in sequence to model cause 
and effect. 

When a small change to the initial conditions of a system cannot guarantee a 
predictable outcome, then the behavior of that system can be said to be chaotic. 
The chaotic behavior takes place on an attractor if a large proportion of these 
conditions result in trajectories that converge to and orbit around a chaotic 
region. The Lorenz attractor, discovered by 
[Edward Lorenz](http:s//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lorenz) shows one such orbit 
that looks like a butterfly. The logo captures this image with the proposition 
that gwen can detect chaos.
