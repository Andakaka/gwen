Gwen
====

Gwen is a [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) interpreter that turns Given-When-Then
steps into automation instructions and executes them for you so you don't have to do all the programming work. It has
an abstracted [evaluation engine](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Evaluation-Engines) allowing any type of
automation capability to be built and mixed in.
[Meta specifications](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Meta-Features) (also expressed in Gherkin) are used
to capture automation bindings and allow you to compose step definitions in a declarative manner.

Why Gwen?
---------

> Gwen = [G]iven [W]hen Th[en]

We wanted to make automation easier for non developers with little to no coding experience. So we developed an
interpreter to read plain text Gherkin features as input and produce executing automation instructions as output
through automation engines that can be developed and shared.

What engines are available?
---------------------------

- [gwen-web](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web)
 Â - A web automation engine for Gwen that you can download and use to quickly automate web application testing and
    robotic online processing without having to develop any page objects or Selenium code.
