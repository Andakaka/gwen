Gwen
====

Gwen is aÂ [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) interpreter that turns
[Given-When-Then](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Given-When-Then) steps into automation instructions and
executes them for you so you don't have to do all the programming work. It has an abstracted
[evaluation engine](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Evaluation-Engines)
allowing any type of automation capability to be mixed in and reused. For example, we have built and
shared a [web engine](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web) that you can download and use to automate web
application testing and robotic web activities.
[Meta specifications](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Meta-Features) (also expressed in Gherkin) can be
used to capture automation bindings and map 'declarative' feature steps to 'imperative' engine steps that perform operations.
