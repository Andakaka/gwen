Gwen
====

Gwen is a [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) interpreter that turns Given-When-Then
steps into automation instructions and executes them for you so you don't have to do all the programming work. It has
an abstracted [evaluation engine](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Evaluation-Engines) allowing any type of
automation capability to be mixed in and reused.
[Meta specifications](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Meta-Features) (also expressed in Gherkin) are used
to capture automation bindings and allow you to compose step definitions by mapping 'declarative' steps in features to
'imperative' steps in
[@StepDef scenarios](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen/wiki/Meta-Features#composable-step-definitions)
that perform operations through pre-programmed automation engines.

Why Gwen?
---------

> Gwen = [G]iven [W]hen Th[en]

Most Gherkin tools and frameworks target BDD (Behavior Driven Development) and therefore adopt a very developer-centric
or programmatic approach to verifying the behavior of code and driving its development. We wanted to build a BDA
(Behavior Driven Automation) tool that could use Gherkin to automate acceptance testing and robotic processing instead
with only little or no coding at all required on behalf of the user. So we built the Gwen interpreter to read Gherkin as input and produce executing instructions as output through automation engines that can be prebuilt with specific capabilities
and mixed in.

What engines are available?
---------------------------

- [gwen-web](https://github.com/gwen-interpreter/gwen-web)
 Â - Our first engine is the gwen-web engine that we built on top of Selenium. You can download and use it to do web automation without having to develop any code to interact with Selenium.
